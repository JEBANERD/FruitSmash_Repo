## Core Experience Snapshot

FruitSmash is positioned as a frantic multiplayer brawler stacked with power-ups, social play, and rotating events, encouraging squads to chase cosmetics and tournament leaderboards ([store blurb](../Marketing/StoreAssets/blurbs/en-US.json)).

## Key Systems at a Glance

- **EconomyServer** centralizes point and coin rewards, wiring fruit hits and round bonuses into leaderboard submissions and player attributes ([ServerScriptService/Economy/EconomyServer.lua](../ServerScriptService/Economy/EconomyServer.lua)).
- **LeaderboardServer** pushes live session standings and optionally syncs a global ordered DataStore for long-term competition ([ServerScriptService/Data/LeaderboardServer.lua](../ServerScriptService/Data/LeaderboardServer.lua)).
- **TutorialUI** coordinates onboarding, adapting steps to the player‚Äôs input mode and remote tutorial state ([StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/Controllers/TutorialUI.client.lua](../StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/Controllers/TutorialUI.client.lua)).
- **VersionAnnounce** surfaces build metadata (version, commit, timestamps) into logs and game attributes for runtime diagnostics ([ServerScriptService/Analytics/VersionAnnounce.server.lua](../ServerScriptService/Analytics/VersionAnnounce.server.lua)).

## Getting Started

1. Install the [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/landing/studio) tooling bundle if you have not already.
2. Launch `FruitSmash_V2.rbxl` in Studio for quick inspection of the current content drop.
3. Use the bundled `rojo.exe` to sync code changes into Studio with `./rojo.exe serve default.project.json`.
4. Confirm build metadata in the output window (`[VersionAnnounce] FruitSmash v...`) before publishing test instances ([VersionAnnounce](../ServerScriptService/Analytics/VersionAnnounce.server.lua)).

## Release Assets

- Store copy and localization strings live in `Marketing/StoreAssets/blurbs/` alongside per-locale JSON stubs ([blurbs README](../Marketing/StoreAssets/blurbs/README.md)).
- Icon, screenshot, and trailer guidelines are documented in the `Marketing/StoreAssets/` subfolders before upload drives ([marketing overview](../Marketing/StoreAssets/README.md), [trailer notes](../Marketing/StoreAssets/trailer/README.md), [screenshot plan](../Marketing/StoreAssets/screenshots/README.md)).
