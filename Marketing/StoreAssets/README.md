## Overview

This folder tracks metadata for the experience store presence and marketing collateral. Binary assets (icon, screenshots, trailer) are stored on the shared marketing drive and mirrored in Roblox uploads; reference the manifest and per-asset notes when preparing releases.

## Contents

- `manifest.json` — central manifest listing Roblox asset ids and source filenames.
- `icon/` — notes for the primary store icon export.
- `screenshots/` — slot planning and capture notes for store screenshots.
- `trailer/` — export + upload checklist for the launch trailer slot.
- `blurbs/` — localized copy stubs for store descriptions.

Update the manifest after any re-upload so QA can verify the correct builds are live.
